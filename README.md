# Cogent: COding GENome reconstruction Tool

Current version: 1.0

Cogent is a tool for reconstructing the coding genome using high-quality full-length transcriptome sequences. It is designed to be used on [Iso-Seq data](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki) and in cases where there is no reference genome or the ref genome is highly incomplete. 

See a [recent presentation](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mn6hwhguh0pqceu/20160106_Cogent_developers_conference_slides_Cuttlefish.pdf?dl=0) on Cogent being applied to the Cuttlefish Iso-Seq data. 

Please see [wiki](https://github.com/Magdoll/Cogent/wiki) for details on usage.
